            This website has been created mostly out of sentimental fondness, 
            I'm not a hard core gamer any longer. <br>I'm a curious front-end developer.
        </div>

        <p>
            There it is, full disclosure. TITAN's game design and graphics hold a
            magical appeal and this is the reason for the site. Recently my
            technical curiosity, for WebGL lead me to learn BabylonJs, and
            recreate tic-tac-toe in 3D. A project to learn that frame work.
            When that was done I wanted a different project that would present a
            more complex gameplay, and I remembered TITAN. 
        </p>
        <div class="disclaimer">
       My idea was "what if ... TITAN was an interactive 3D masterboard and battlelands?
        </div>
        <p>
            So I had a look around and discovered a really active comminuty, with
            amazing implimentations and regular activity, so instead of trying
            to reinvent the wheel, I have resoted to spend my time on more
            graphical interpretations, using Blender and low poly models, to see
            what TITAN might have looked like now.
        </p>

        <p>
            But TITAN is very seductive, and complex and a phenominal work of
            design and it has taken ages to systematically recreate the board,
            battle fields and legion creatures, which are required for the 3D, so I
            give these to you, and perhaps you will find them valuable.
