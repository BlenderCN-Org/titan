                This website has been created mostly out of sentimental
                fondness, I'm not a hard core gamer any longer. <br />I'm a
                curious front-end developer.

                    There it is, full disclosure. TITAN's game design and
                    graphics hold a magical appeal and this is the reason for
                    the site. Recently my technical curiosity, for WebGL lead me
                    to learn BabylonJs, and I set myself the objective to
                    recreated tic-tac-toe. I like having a project when learing
                    a new frame work. So I set about turning the old familiar
                    two player trivial matrix, into a multiplayer three
                    dimentional matrix, with point accumulation for scoring the
                    winner and a special out-right victory condition, that
                    awards the strategic player. It's like noughts-and-crossed
                    on a Rubiks cube, where the size of the cube is a variable,
                    and you can have human or random opponents. When that was
                    done I wanted a different project that would present a more
                    complex gameplay, and I remembered TITAN. The idea was ...
                    "what if TITAN was an interactive 3D masterboard and
                    battlelands?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I looked around and discovered a really active comminuty,
                    with amazing implimentations and regular activity, so
                    instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, I have resoted to
                    spend my time on more graphical interpretations, using
                    Blender and low poly models, to see what TITAN might have
                    looked like.
                </p>

                <p>
                    TITAN is very seductive, a complex and a phenominal work of
                    design and it has taken ages to systematically recreate the
                    board, battle fields and legion creatures, which are
                    required assets for the 3D concept art. So I give these to
                    you, and perhaps you will find them valuable.
