## movement

Here is a Summery of the movement rules for your questions
above:

The Mover rolls a die for his Movement Roll. He must
move at least one of his Legions, and may move more.

As each Legion is moved, flip its Legion marker to indicate it
is finished. A legion must finish its movement before another
can begin.

A moving Legion must move as many Lands as the number
rolled on the die, or until it enters an enemy-occupied Land,
whichever comes first.

Characters may not be dropped off or moved separately.

A Legion may move through a friendly Legion’s Land but
may not end its move there.

If a Legion enters an enemy-occupied Land, those Legions
are locked in an Engagement and no further movement into
or across that Land is allowed this turn (Ex: Summoned
Angels).

All moves follow the Signs from Land to Land (Ex:
Teleportation).

**Movement Signs:**

Block – a Legion starting on a Land from which a Block
points must begin its next move in that direction.

Sphere – a Legion starting on a Land from which a Sphere
points may begin its next move in that direction.

Arrow – a Legion starting on a Tower may begin its next
move in the direction of any of the Arrows.

A Legion continuing a move through a Land from which a
single Arrow points may continue its move in the direction of
any of the Arrows, but it may not backtrack (i.e., return
directly to the land it just exited).

Triple Arrow – a Legion starting on a Land from which a
Triple Arrow points may begin its next move in that direction
(unless the Land also contains a Block).

A Legion continuing a move through a Land from which a
Triple Arrow points must move in that direction if it is still
able to move.
