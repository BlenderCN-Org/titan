# Blender concept art

Recently I decided to create a DOM overlay for ACTS, to add some graphics to the existring DOM, by using the Google [Chrome Extension](../extension/) API. To achieve this I had to recreate the graphic assets of the TITAN creatures, terrains and hazards. A huge undertaking, and very laborious. Anyway I did it, and in the process I wondered what the game might look like in 3D.



So I opened the trusty [Blender](https://blender.org/) and used the newly created SVG assets to visualise the Battlelands in a three dimensions. The models are low polygon expressions of the existing maps, with SVG creature icons extruded. No bump-maps, textures, or fine details, just some furniture and tile elevations. Nothing impressive, but very fun to do. I will create all of the battlelands, but for the moment there are only 2, plus a very rough Mainboard.

Imagine if the people that created "[WarTile](http://www.wartile.com/)" did their magic on TITAN? Wow!
